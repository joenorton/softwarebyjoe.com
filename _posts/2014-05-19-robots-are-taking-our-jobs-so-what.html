                        <p class="lead"><img src="/static/img/jerbs.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;" class="well"/>Many people are concerned about software, and hardware too - particularly robots, "taking our jobs" and putting us out of work.<br /><br />The question is NOT: are robots taking our jobs? because they obviously are.<br /><br />The question is: what will we do with our time when we are all living the 4 hour work week?<br /><br />Let me paint you a picture of why us slowly losing our jobs to robots is a good thing.</p>


<p class="well">The idea that technological innovation causes a long-run net loss of jobs is false. There is definitely some component of technological unemployment that happens from any innovation, and this means that some people who have been made obsolete are forced to re-train and go into a new industry, and though that certainly can be painful to individuals what we see in the long-run, for society as a whole, are resouces being used more efficiently as these once required human hours are now automated. Those human hours can be spent on other, more fruitful, things that they weren't free to do before.

Think of the sewing machine.</p><p class="well"> It's invention undoubtedly put out of work countless seamstresses. As the job of rooms full of women sewing could now be replaced with a machine. Though it was painful for those individuals to change careers, this technological change increased the quality of life for everybody. Although those sewing jobs themselves are gone, new fields provided the jobs that would end up employing the daughters and granddaugthers of seamstresses. Jobs in fields they would've never imagined. Thomas Sowell has a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hQX6-P0N2nUC&lpg=PA285&vq=sewing&pg=PA285#v=onepage&q=sewing%20machine&f=false" title="Google Books: 'Basic Economics, by Thomas Sowell" target="_blank">nice example of this in his book 'Basic Economics'</a>.

<p>Personally, I can't wait for a society that is past requiring the 40 hour work week. It blows my mind to think about all the time and effort that could be spent exploring, inventing, creating, thinking, etc. once we shrink the work requirements in our society. Is that wishful thinking?</p>
<p class="lead">Will we become fat, dumb, and lazy slobs?</p><img src="/static/img/wall-e.jpg" class="well"/> <img src="/static/img/idiocracy.jpg" class="well"/><br /><p class="lead">Or will we become more like the society seen in Star Trek -- a place where scarcity almost seems to not exist at all?</p><img src="/static/img/trek.png" class="well" />
<br />
<p class="lead">I think this is a question that will be answered by our culture.</p><p class="well">It may not be easy to guide culture... but what we have going for us is that despite that our jobs (and lives) are more sedentary there are still many utilitarian reasons why it makes sense to be healthy (similar to how it ‘makes cents’ for companies to ‘go green’). There are obvious health benefits to a lifestyle that includes exercise and a well-rounded, not exceedingly high-calorie, diet. Additionally there are social factors at work that are pushing people to want to look more attractive.</p>

<p>Maybe we will always work 40 hours. And that's okay, for workaholics like me - this is the way we'd probably prefer it, but the point is that it's not required to survive - and that there is this free time for creativity, learning, growing, etc. I'd much rather the typical American work 4 hours at their corporate job, and then go home and spend 36 hours fiddling with their hobbies, and then call it a week!</p>

<p>There's this idea out there called Idle Theory, here is a nice paragraph summarizing it: <blockquote>Human life, historically, is taken to have been hard. The uniquely human response was the development of tools. These tools speeded up human work: a knife enabled materials to be cut more quickly; a bag allowed materials to be transported more rapidly. And since they expedited work, the use of these tools increased human idleness. The inherent purpose of an economic system is to free people from work.</p>

</blockquote></p>

<p>Basically, man seeks idle time. Thru innovation, and creation, man pursues idle time. All creatures do, because essentially it is the drive to survive with less effort. Increasing idleness means increased freedom and increased wealth.</p>
         <p>On that note: let's go outsource ourselves! Who's with me?!</p>
